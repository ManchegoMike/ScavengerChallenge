# ScavengerChallenge

Written by ManchegoMike ([Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ManchegoMike)),
based the "Scavenger" achievement
in the original [Hardcore addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/hardcore).

The Scavenger Challenge is a hardcore (no deaths) self-found (no mail, no
auction house) challenge whereby you have to rely solely on loot, not quest
rewards, to get items throughout your journey to 60.

This addon warns you if you try to use/consume/equip an item unless you looted
it from a mob, chest, or loot container, or crafted or conjured it yourself.

You can sell to merchants, but you are not allowed to buy any items from them.
This includes food, drinks, potions, projectiles, trade goods, and containers.
However, you *are* allowed to buy spell reagents and a few items to get you
started with gathering professions (skinning knife, mining pick, fishing
pole).

You are not allowed to use/consume/equip items rewarded by a quest
(items provided *for* a quest can be used, consumed, or equipped).

All items you start with can be used/consumed/equipped, including a
Hearthstone.

Wherever possible, you should do this challenge on a hardcore server in
self-found mode (no mail, no auction house, no trading).

NOTE: There is an issue with the way WoW gets merchant item information from the
server, which can cause some merchant screens to black out every item even
though some items are allowed. If you see a page that's all black and you're
not sure it should be, close the vendor UI and open it up again, or go from one
page to the next and back again a few times. That will usually "goose" the
server into returning the data the addon needs.

## Usage

You can use the console command `/scavenger` or `/scav`.
