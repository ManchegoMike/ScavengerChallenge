# ScavengerChallenge

Written by ManchegoMike ([Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ManchegoMike)),
based the "Scavenger" and "Vagrant" achievements
in the original [Hardcore addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/hardcore).

This addon helps support the Scavenger challenge in Classic WoW.

In a nutshell, the Scavenger Challenge is: no dying, no trading, no mail, no
auction house, no quest rewards, no buying from vendors (with a few
exceptions), no hearth, no bank.

You are a scavenger, living off whatever you can find, and the few things you
can make. Vendors will buy from you, but no one will sell you anything. This
includes food, drinks, potions, projectiles, reagents, trade goods, and
containers. However, you *can* buy a fishing pole, mining pick, skinning knife,
blacksmith hammer, and a level 40 mount. You can use any professions you want,
but you can only go so far without reagents or trade goods.

You cannot keep, use, consume, or equip quest rewards.

You also cannot use banks, hearthstones, or Astral Recall. (These rules are
optional and you can override them before reaching level 8.) You cannot use
mage teleports because they require a reagent. You can accept a portal or a
summon.

You cannot trade or use mail, but if you need to, you can have the addon give
you one minute of temporary access.

Type "/scav" for help.

Languages supported: English (enUS), German (deDE), Spanish (esES), French
(frFR), Italian (itIT), Russian (ruRU), Chinese (zhTW), Korean (koKR).

This addon is also compatible with any 3.x client (like Project Epoch): just
edit the .toc file and change the interface number on the first line to 30300.

Wherever possible, you should do this challenge on a hardcore server in
self-found mode (no mail, no auction house, no trading).

## Usage

You can use the console command `/scavenger` or `/scav`.
